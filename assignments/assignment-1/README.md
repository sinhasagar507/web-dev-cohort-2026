# HTML Resume - Sagar Sinha

## Project Description
This project is a single-page personal resume website built entirely using **semantic HTML5**. 

Created as part of the **Web Dev Cohort 2026** assignment, the goal is to replicate a specific linear document layout without relying on CSS for styling. It demonstrates mastery of core HTML elements including tables, lists, horizontal rules, and semantic document structure.


## Features
* **Semantic Structure:** Uses `<header>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` for proper document outlining.
* **Data Tables:** Professional formatting of Education and Experience history using HTML `<table>` elements with borders.
* **Linear Layout:** Follows a specific top-to-bottom flow using `<hr>` tags for visual separation.
* **Zero CSS:** Pure HTML implementation focusing on raw content structure and browser default rendering.
